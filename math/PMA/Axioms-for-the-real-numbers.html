<h1 class="title">Axioms for the Real Numbers</h1>
<p>
We state here the axioms for the real number system \(\mathbb{R}\).
We shall accept these axioms without proof but
it can proved (from more general axioms)
that there is an essentially unique structure satisfying them.
</p>


<p>
<b>Algebraic Axioms</b> .
The set \(\mathbb{R}\) of <b>real numbers</b>  is equipped with two operations
\[
\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}:(a,b)\mapsto a+b,\qquad\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}:(a,b)\mapsto a\cdot b
\]
such that the usual laws of grade school arithmetic hold:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Commutative Laws</b> \(a+b=b+a\) and \(a\cdot b=b\cdot a\).</li>
<li><b>Associative Laws</b>  \((a+b)+c=a+(b+c)\) and \((a\cdot b)\cdot c= a\cdot (b\cdot c)\).</li>
<li><b>Distributive Law</b> \((a+b)\cdot c= (a\cdot c)+(b\cdot c)\).</li>
<li><b>Zero,One</b> There are (necessarily unique) distinct elements \(0,1\in\mathbb{R}\) such that \(a+0=a\) and \(a\cdot 1=a\) for all \(a\in\mathbb{R}\).</li>
<li><b>Inverses</b> For every \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) there is a (necessarily unique) element \(-a\) such that \(a+(-a)=0\). For every \(a\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\) there is a (necessarily unique) element \(a^{-1}\) such that \(a\cdot a^{-1}=1\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The standard notations from high school algebra are used:
 in particular, \(ab:=a\cdot b\), \(a-b:=a+(-b)\), and \(a/b=a\cdot b^{-1}\).
</p>


<p>
<b>Order Axioms</b> .   The set \(\mathbb{R}\) has an order relation
denoted $ a &lt; b$ satisfying the following laws for all \(a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}\):
</p>

<p>
<b>Trichotomy</b>   Exactly one of the alternatives    $ a &lt; b$, \(a=b\), \(b < a\), holds.
<b>Transitivity</b>    \(a < b,\;b < c\implies a < c\).
<b>Addition</b>    \(a < b\implies a+c < b+c\).
<b>Multiplication</b>     \(0 < a,b\implies 0 < ab\).
</p>

<p>
The other order notations are defined as usual, i.e.
\(a < b\iff b>a\) and \(a\le b\iff b\ge a\iff\) either \(a < b\) or \(a=b\).
</p>


<p>
All the rules of algebra used in College Algebra
 follow from the Algebraic Axioms and Order Axioms.
For example, \((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\), \(a^2\ge 0\), etc.
</p>


<p>
A set \(S\)  of real numbers is said to be <b>bounded above</b> iff there is
a  number \(b\in\mathbb{R}\) such that $x&le; b $ for all \(x\in S\);
the number \(b\) is  then called an <b>upper bound</b>  for \(S\).
A number \(b\in\mathbb{R}\) is called a <b>least upper bound</b>  for \(S\) iff
it is an upper bound for \(S\) and
\(b\le b'\) for every other upper bound \(b'\) for \(S\).
</p>

<p>
 Similarly  the set \(S\) is said to be <b>bounded below</b>  iff there is
an number \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) such that \(a\le x\) for all \(x\in S\);
the element \(b\) is  then called a  <b>lower bound</b>  for \(S\).
</p>

<p>
An element \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) is called a <b>greatest lower bound</b>
iff it is an lower bound for \(S\) and  \(a'\le a\) for every other lower bound
\(a'\) for \(S\).  The words <b>infimum</b>  and <b>greatest lower bound</b> are synonymous
as are the   words <b>supremum</b>  and <b>least upper bound</b>.
The least upperbound of the set \(S\) will be denoted \(\sup(S)\)
and
the greatest lower bound of the set \(S\) will be denoted \(\inf(S)\).
We write \(\sup(S)=\infty\) when \(S\) is not bounded above and \(\inf(S)=-\infty\)
when \(S\) is not bounded below.
</p>


<p>
<b>Completeness Axiom</b> .
Every set \(S\) of real numbers which is bounded above has a least upper bound, i.e.
</p>

<p>
if \(x\le b\) for all \(x\in S\), then \(x\le \sup(S)\le b\) for all \(x\in S\).
</p>

<p>
Because multiplication by \(-1\) reverses the order it is the same to say that every set which is bounded below has a greatest lower bound. Thus
</p>

<p>
if \(a\le x\) for all \(x\in S\), then
\(a\le \inf(S)\le x\) for all \(x\in S\).
</p>

<p>
For Morgan the completeness axiom is a theorem (see page~44 of his book)
but most authors of undergraduate texts don't prove it.
Of course it can't be proved until we give a precise construction (definition)
of the real numbers.
</p>

<p>
Morgan takes the view that a real number is a number with
a decimal expansion, but avoids certain subtle issues connected
with this view.
</p>

<p>
Actually making his definition precise would involve defining how to do
the arithmetic operations with decimal expansions and would be
a bit tedious.  To see why, imagine that \(a+b=c\) and that
\[
  a=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n10^{-n},\qquad
  b=\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n10^{-n},\qquad
  c=\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n10^{-n},
\]
where the coefficients, \(a_n,b_n,c_n\) are integers between \(0\) and \(9\)
and try to express \(c_n\) in terms the \(a_n\)'s and the \(b_n\)'s.
In an appendix to his book, Buck sketches a construction the real numbers
by something called <b>Dedekind cuts</b>   but leaves out many details.
Rudin explains cuts in an appendix to his chapter~1.
(The book {\em Foundations of Analysis} by Edmund Landau gives all the details.)
The completeness axiom is an easy consequence of this construction.
One can also define the real numbers using `equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences'
 and again the completeness axiom is a consequence;
</p>

<p>
if we get to the topic of completion of metric spaces, I'll explain it then.
</p>

<p>
The crucial point is the uniqueness `up to isomorphism'.
</p>

<p>
It means that if we start from  the axioms, it doesn't matter what
definition of the real numbers we use.
