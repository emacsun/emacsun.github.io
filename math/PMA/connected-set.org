#+begin_definition
 A set $S$ is *disconnected* iff there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $S\subseteq U\cup V$ and both $S\cap U$ and $S\cap V$ are nonempty.

A set is *connected* iff it is not disconnected.
#+end_definition
#+begin_tikztheorem
 A subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$  of the real line is connected if and only if $S$ is an interval, i.e.
 $[a,b]\subseteq S$ whenever $a,b\in S$.
#+end_tikztheorem
#+begin_proof
  Assume $S$ is not an interval, i.e. that there exist $a,b\in S$ with $[a,b]\not\subseteq S$. Then there is a $c\in[a,b]$ with $c\notin S$.

Let $U=(-\infty,c)$ and $V=(c,\infty)$. The point $c$ lies in the open interval $(a,b)$ as $a,b\in S$ so $a\in U$ and $b\in V$. Hence both $S\cap U$ and $S\cap V$ are nonempty and clearly $S\subseteq U\cup V$ (as $c\notin S$). Hence the open sets $U$ and $V$ separate $S$
so $S$ is disconnected as required.

 Assume that $S$ is disconnected, i.e. that there exist open sets $U,V\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ with $S\subseteq U\cup V$, $S\cap U\ne\emptyset$, $S\cap V\ne\emptyset$, and  $U\cap V=\emptyset$. We must show that $S$ is not an interval. Choose $a\in S\cap U$ and $b\in S\cap V$. Then $a\ne b$ as $U\cap V=\emptyset$. Assume without loss of generality that $a < b$.
(The case $b < a$ is the same.)

The set $[a,b]\cap U$ is nonempty (it contains $a$) and bounded above ($b$ is an upper bound).
Let $c=\sup([a,b]\cap U)$.
Since $a\in U$ there is an $\epsilon > 0$ with $(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon)\subseteq U$.
Making $\epsilon$ smaller we also have $a+\epsilon < b$.
Therefore $[a,a+\epsilon)\subseteq [a,b]\cap U)$
so $a+\epsilon=\sup\,[a,a+\epsilon)\le\sup\, [a,b]\cap U=c$.
Since $b\in V$ there is an(other) $\epsilon > 0$ with $(b-\epsilon,b+\epsilon)\subseteq V$.
Making $\epsilon$ smaller we also have $a < b-\epsilon$.
Therefore $(b-\epsilon,b]\subseteq [a,b]\cap V)$ so
$[b-\epsilon,b]\cap V=\emptyset$ so $b-\epsilon$ is an upperbound for $[a,b]\cap U$,
so $c\le b-\epsilon$. We have proved that $a < c < b$.
If $c\in U$ there is an $\epsilon > 0$
with $a < c-\epsilon < c < c+\epsilon < b$ and $(c-\epsilon,c+\epsilon)\subseteq U$ contradicting the fact
that $c$ is an upper bound of $[a,b]\cap U$.
If $c\in V$ there is an $\epsilon > 0$
with $a < c-\epsilon < c < c+\epsilon < b$ and $(c-\epsilon,c+\epsilon)\subseteq V$
so $c-\epsilon$ is an upperbound for $[a,b]\cap U$
contradicting the fact
that $c$ is the least upper bound of $[a,b]\cap U$. Hence $c\notin U\cup V$ so
(as $S\subseteq U\cup V$) $c\notin S$. Thus $a < c < b$, $a\in S$, $b\in S$, $c\notin S$,
so $S$ is not an interval.

#+begin_tikztheorem
 The continuous image of  a connected set is connected:
 If $f:X\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous and $X$ is connected,
then $f(X)$ is connected.
#+end_tikztheorem
#+begin_tikztheorem
 Assume that $S$ is connected and that $f:S\to\mathbb{R}$
is continuous. Suppose that $a,b\in f(S)$
and that $a <  c  < b$. Then $c\in f(S)$.
#+end_tikztheorem

 The Intermediate Value Theorem from calculus
is a special case. It says that if
$f:[\alpha,\beta]\to\mathbb{R}$ is a real valued continuous
function on the closed interval $[\alpha,\beta]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$,
$\{a,b\}=\{f(\alpha),f(\beta)\}$, and $a\le c\le b$, then the equation
$f(x)=c$ has a solution $x\in[\alpha,\beta]$.
#+begin_tikztheorem
 A continuous function $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ defined on an interval $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$
is injective if and only if it is strictly monotonic.
When these equivalent conditions hold, the image $J=f(I)$ is
again an interval and the inverse function is continuous.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_tikztheorem
Let $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an interval and $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be  $f$ is continuous.
Then the set \[\mathrm{graph}(f):=\{(x,y)\in I\times\mathbb{R}: y=f(x)\}\] is connected.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_proof
 Define $F:I\to\mathbb{R}$ by $F(x)=(x,f(x))$ so that $F(I)=\mathrm{graph}(f)$.
Clearly $f$ is continuous if and only if $F$ is continuous.
We will assume that $I$ is an open interval; the case where $I$ contains one of its endpoints is similar.
Assume that  $F(I)$ is not connected. Then  there are open sets $U,V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with
$F(I)\subseteq U\cup V$, $U\cap V=\emptyset$,
$F(I)\cap U\ne\emptyset$, $F(I)\cap V\ne\emptyset$.
Then $F^{-1}(U),F^{-1}(V)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ are open, $I\subseteq F^{-1}(U)\cup F^{-1}(V)$,
and $F^{-1}(U)\cup F^{-1}(V)=F^{-1}(U\cap V)=\emptyset$.
This contradicts the fact that $I$ is an interval and therefore connected.
#+end_proof



 The converse is false. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by
$$
 f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \sin(1/x) & \mbox{ if } x > 0,\\
                                0 & \mbox{ if } x\le 0.
             \end{array}\right.
$$
This function is not continuous as follows. Let $x_n=(2n\pi+\pi/2)^{-1}$.
Then $f(x_n)=1$,  $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=0$, but $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(x_n)=1\ne 0=f(0)$.
However, the graph of $f$ is connected.
To see this suppose $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
$\mathrm{graph}(f)\subseteq U\cup V$ with $U\cup V=\emptyset$. Suppose that $(0,0)\in U$.
Then $(x,f(x))\in U$ for $x\le 0$ as $f$ is continuous on $(-\infty,0]$ and
$(x,f(x))\in U$ in $U$ for $x > 0$  as $f$ is continuous on $(0,\infty)$. But then
$\mathrm{graph}(f)\subset U$ so $\mathrm{graph}(f)\cap V=\emptyset$.
