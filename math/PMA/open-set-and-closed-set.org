In all the following definitions the term *set* means *subset of* $\mathbb{R}^m$.

#+begin_definition
A set  $U$ is *open* iff for every $p\in U$
there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $B(p,\delta)\subseteq U$.
#+end_definition


#+begin_tikztheorem
The collection of all open sets in $\mathbb{R}^m$ satisfies the following conditions:
1. The  set  $\mathbb{R}^m$ and the empty set $\emptyset$ are both open.
2. The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
3. The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.
#+end_tikztheorem
#+begin_proof
 The set $\mathbb{R}^m$ is open because $B(p,1)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ for $p\in\mathbb{R}^m$.
The empty set is open because for every $p\in\emptyset$
satisfies the required condition -- or any other condition --  since
*`false $implies$ anything' is true*.
To prove~(2) assume $U$ is open.  Then for  every point $p\in U$ there is a $\delta=\delta_p$
such that $B(p,\delta_p)\subseteq U$.[fn::This is actually an example of an application of the Axiom of Choice.]

It follows that
$$
       U=\bigcup_{p\in U} B(p,\delta_p),
$$
i.e. that $U$ is an union of balls. A union of unions is a union:
$$
     \bigcup_{i\in I}\bigcup_{j\in I_j} B_{ij}=\bigcup_{(i,j)\in K} B_{ij},
     \qquad
     K:=\{(i,j): i\in I,\; j\in I_j\}
$$
so~(2) follows.

To prove~(3) assume that $U_1,U_2,\ldots U_m$ are open and choose an arbitrary point $p\in\bigcap_{i=1}^m U_i$. Then $p\in U_i$ so there is a $\delta_i > 0$ with $B(p,\delta_i)\subseteq U_i$.

Let $\delta=\min(\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_m)$. Then
$$
   B(p,\delta)\subseteq \bigcap_{i=1}^m B(p,\delta_i)\subseteq \bigcap_{i=1}^m U_i
$$
as required.
#+end_proof
#+begin_definition
A set $W\subseteq X$ is called *relatively open* in $X$ iff for every $p\in W$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $B_X(p,\delta)\subseteq W$.
#+end_definition

A set $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ is open if and only if it is relatively open in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
For this reason many theorems can be generalized by systematically replacing $\mathbb{R}^m$ by $X$, $B(p,\delta)$ by $B_X(p,\delta)$, and the word {\em open} by the phrase {\em relatively open in $X$}.

#+begin_tikztheorem
A set $W$ is relatively open in $X$ if and only if $W=X\cap U$ for some  open set $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_tikztheorem
A map $f:X\to $Y is continuous if and only if the inverse image $f^{-1}(V)$ of every relatively open subset $V$ of $Y$ is a relatively open subset of $X$.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_tikztheorem
 Assume that $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are continuous. Then $g\circ f:X\to Z$ is continuous.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_definition
A set $X$ is \jdef{closed} iff its complement $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus X$ is open.
#+end_definition

#+begin_tikztheorem
The collection of all closed sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the following conditions:
1.  The  set  $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the empty set $\emptyset$ of both closed.
2. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.
3. The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed.
#+end_tikztheorem

#+begin_tikztheorem
A set $S$ is closed if and only if it is closed under limits of sequences, i.e. whenever $\lim_{n\to\infty} p_n=p$  and each $p_n\in S$ we have $p\in S$.
#+end_tikztheorem
#+begin_proof
To prove {\em only if} assume that $S$ is closed, that $\lim_{n\to\infty} p_n=p$,  and that each $p_n\in S$. If $p\notin S$ then $p\in\mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$.

As this set is open  there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $B(p,\delta)\subset \mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$.
As the sequence converges to $p$ there is an $N$ such that $p_n\in B(p,\delta)$ for $n > N$ contradicting the
hypothesis that $p_n\in S$. To prove {\em if} assume that $S$ is not closed.
Then $\mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$ is not open so there is a point $p\in\mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$ such that
$B(p,\delta)\not\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$ for every $\delta > 0$. In particular for $\delta=1/n$ there is a point
$p_n\in B(p,1/n)$ (i.e. $|p_n-p|<1/n$) such that $p_n\notin \mathbb{R}^m\setminus S$, i.e. $p_n\in S$. Thus
$\lim_{n\to\infty}p_n=p$ and $p\notin S$ as desired.
#+end_proof

 Let  $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. For any point $p\in\mathbb{R}^n$ exactly one of the following alternatives holds:

1. $B(p,\delta)\subseteq S$ for some $\delta > 0$.
2. $B(p,\delta)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\setminus S$ for some $\delta > 0$.
3. $B(p,\delta)\cap S\ne\emptyset$ and $B(p,\delta)\cap (\mathbb{R}^n\setminus S)\ne\emptyset$ for all $\delta > 0$.

The *interior* of  $S$ is the set $\mathrm{int}(S)$ of all points $p$  where~(1) holds,
the *exterior*  of $S$ is the set  $\mathrm{ext}(S)$ of all points $p$  where~(2) holds, and
the *boundary* of a set $S$ is the set $\mathrm{bdry}(S)$ of all points $p$  where~() holds.
The ambient space $\mathbb{R}^n$ may be written as the pairwise disjoint union \[ \mathbb{R}^n=\mathrm{int}(S)\cup\mathrm{ext}(S)\cup\mathrm{bdry}(S).\]


The notations \[ \stackrel{\circ}{S}\;:=\mathrm{int}(S),\qquad \partial S := \mathrm{bdry}(S)\]
are commonly used.


For the half open interval $S=[a,b)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ we have \[\mathrm{int}(S)=(a,b),\qquad \mathrm{ext}(S)=(-\infty,a)\cup (b,\infty),\qquad \mathrm{bdry}(S)=\{a,b\}.\]

#+begin_definition
A set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is \jdef{closed} iff its complement
$\mathbb{R}^n\setminus S$ is open. The \jdef{closure} of the set $S$
is the set
$$
   \mathrm{cl}(S):=\bar{S}:=S\cup\mathrm{bdry}(S).
$$
#+end_definition

#+begin_tikztheorem
The interior $\mathrm{int}(S)$ of $S$ is the largest open set contained in $S$  and closure  $\bar{S}$ of $S$  is the smallest closed set containing $S$.
#+end_tikztheorem
